  Now that you discovered your DF problem and identified all this informations, it's IR solutions time!

  To construct the flag you have to:

  1- write a command/rule to block the malicious ip in silence :
  SuitableCommand_parametrs_IP_parameters

  You might noticed that some security measures were disabled while other were in a less secure mode

  2- identify them and write the suitable full command to reactivate/enforce them

  Flag format : all lower case, no spaces, just underscores, and points if needed

  If there is a command like this for exemple :

  "Cat -O ingehack.txt"
  It shall be written as :
  `cat_o_ingehack.txt`

  (there is a dot between each 2 full commands)

  `ingehack{full_command1.full_command2.full_command3}`

  **NOTE**: Use same Zip file as the Log2 Intro Challenge

flag: ingehack{iptables_a_input_s_51.222.136.32_j_drop.systemctl_enable_auditd.setenforce_1}
