  Things are getting serious, looks like there are many attackers,   
  but we shoud definitely report the main one,   
  cuz that dude installed him self apparently.. ( and he tried to hide in addition!)

  To construct the flag you have to get:
  1- the name of the malware type
  2- connection port
  3-command used to hide the attack
  4-the attacker's province 

  Flag format : all lower case, no spaces, just underscores, and points if needed:

  `ingehack{malwaretype_port_command_province}`

flag: ingehack{cronrat_4444_logrotate_quebec}






visible: true
